# Public-transport stop data pipeline

## 1. Purpose

The public-transport stop pipeline converts the official FOT/GeoAdmin national
`ch.bav.haltestellen-oev` download into one small immutable catalog consumed by
Via Helvetica. It handles only comparatively static stop positions and metadata.
Timetable departures remain dynamic and are never embedded in this artifact.

The source download, extracted work files, generated releases, R2 credentials,
and local publication configuration stay outside the repository.

## 2. Source data

Use the complete official GeoAdmin download for `ch.bav.haltestellen-oev` in
LV95 (`EPSG:2056`). The current pipeline expects the French CSV export because
its `PointExploitation.csv` schema is covered by the importer tests.

Download and extract the current official source through GeoAdmin STAC v1:

```powershell
npm run download:public-transport-stops-source -- "C:\Temp\haltestellen-oev"
```

The downloader:

1. reads the official STAC collection for `ch.bav.haltestellen-oev`;
2. discovers the French CSV ZIP in LV95 instead of hard-coding its current
   object URL;
3. downloads the untouched ZIP to the requested work directory;
4. extracts into a staging directory and replaces the previous `extracted/` only
   after extraction succeeds, so an interrupted extraction cannot leave a partial
   source;
5. extracts the archive and requires exactly one `PointExploitation.csv`;
6. prints the selected asset URL and the path of that table for auditability.

The work directory stays outside the repository. Re-running the command replaces
the downloaded archive and extracted files, but never modifies a generated or
published immutable release.

If STAC discovery is temporarily unavailable, use the official FOT/BAV dataset
landing page as the manual fallback:

```text
https://www.bav.admin.ch/de/haltestellen-des-oeffentlichen-verkehrs-geoiv-id-982
```

Open `Datendownload` from that page and select the **French CSV export in
LV95 (`EPSG:2056`)**. Its filename follows this pattern:

```text
haltestellen-oev_2056_fr.csv.zip
```

The `_fr` suffix is important: do not select the German `_de` CSV or the
FileGDB, GeoPackage, or INTERLIS variants. Do not copy a physical ZIP object URL
into this documentation or automation: GeoAdmin may change object names or paths
between publications while the official dataset page and STAC collection remain
the stable discovery points.

Extract the downloaded ZIP into a clean work directory before generation.

The generator records a SHA-256 of the exact selected CSV bytes, so release
identity does not depend on the mutable download URL or a manually entered date.
Do not edit the official CSV before generation. If the source schema changes,
adapt and review the importer instead of weakening its plausibility checks.

## 3. Local development artifact

Generate the root-relative development artifact:

```powershell
npm run prepare:public-transport-stops-local -- "C:\Temp\haltestellen-oev"
```

This writes:

```text
public/local-data/public-transport-stops.json
```

The file is ignored by Git and stays directly readable by Vite. Local development
does not create or depend on a Brotli sibling; compression belongs only to the
immutable publication release.

Enable the static provider in `.env.local`:

```text
VITE_PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_STOPS_CATALOG_URL=/local-data/public-transport-stops.json
```

Leaving the variable unset keeps the GeoAdmin identify provider.

## 4. Generator safeguards

Before writing any artifact, the generator must identify a plausible national
`PointExploitation` table. It fails instead of guessing when the source no longer
matches the expected contract.

Current safeguards include:

- exact matching of known semantic source columns;
- a national-scale minimum record count;
- strict UTF-8 decoding and rejection of replacement characters;
- the canonical `PointExploitation.csv` source basename;
- seven-digit DiDok service numbers;
- a broad LV95 coordinate plausibility envelope;
- a minimum share of rows carrying transport metadata;
- explicit logging of the concrete columns selected from the source.

The browser artifact additionally contains:

- source dataset id;
- content-derived `sourceRelease`;
- source CSV basename;
- complete source SHA-256 and source byte length;
- declared final record count;
- compact dictionaries and tuple records.

The browser validates this provenance and checks that `recordCount` equals the
serialized record-array length before building its in-memory index.

## 5. Immutable release layout

Prepare a release outside the repository:

```powershell
npm run prepare:public-transport-stops-release -- `
  "C:\Temp\haltestellen-oev" `
  --release-root "C:\Data\ViaHelveticaPublicTransport"
```

The generator derives the release path from the source SHA-256. A typical layout
is:

```text
C:/Data/ViaHelveticaPublicTransport/
  public-transport-stops-sha256-0123456789abcdef/
    format-v3/
      ch/
        stops.json.br
        release.json
```

`stops.json.br` is the Brotli quality-11 transport representation that will be
served publicly as `stops.json` with HTTP `Content-Encoding: br`. The decoded
JSON is reconstructed only in memory during verification and is not duplicated
in the release directory. `release.json` records source provenance, catalog
SHA-256, decoded and compressed sizes, schema identity, and record count.

Never overwrite a published release path. A source change changes the source
hash and therefore the dataset path. A schema change changes `format-vN`. The
release payload deliberately excludes a generation timestamp, so regenerating
the same source and format produces the same decoded catalog bytes and remains
compatible with immutable publication. `catalogSha256` is the reproducibility
contract; Brotli bytes may differ across future Node/libbrotli versions without
changing the decoded catalog.

Verify the generated release before publication:

```powershell
npm run verify:public-transport-stops-release -- `
  --source "C:\Data\ViaHelveticaPublicTransport\public-transport-stops-sha256-0123456789abcdef\format-v3\ch"
```

The verifier checks the manifest, Brotli byte length, decoded catalog hash and
byte length, provenance, and record count by decompressing `stops.json.br` in
memory. The R2 upload script runs this verification again automatically before
its first write.

## 6. R2 prerequisites

Publication uses an existing rclone S3-compatible remote. Keep all R2 access
credentials in rclone's machine-local configuration.

Copy:

```text
public-transport-data.config.example.json
```

to the Git-ignored:

```text
public-transport-data.config.local.json
```

Then configure:

- `releaseRoot`: the exact generated `.../format-v3/ch` directory;
- `publication.remote`: local rclone remote name;
- `publication.bucket`: target R2 bucket;
- `publication.publicRootUrl`: public custom-domain root for static data;
- `publication.publicOrigin`: deployed Via Helvetica origin allowed by CORS.

The public bucket/domain must permit browser `GET` requests from the origins
that use the catalog. The current Via Helvetica bucket allows
`https://viahelvetica.ch` and `http://localhost:5173`. The public verifier accepts
an exact matching origin (or `*`) and requires `Vary: Origin` when the response is
origin-specific. A production custom domain is preferred over an `r2.dev`
development endpoint so normal Cloudflare caching controls are available.

## 7. Publication metadata contract

R2 stores the compressed bytes under the browser-facing key `stops.json` with:

```text
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Encoding: br
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

The browser therefore fetches a normal JSON URL and receives decoded JSON bytes
through standard HTTP content decoding. It does not know about `.br` and does
not run a JavaScript decompressor.

`release.json` uses the same one-year immutable cache without content encoding.
The publication script uploads `stops.json` first and `release.json` last so published
provenance never claims a complete release before the catalog exists. Application
rollout is controlled separately by `VITE_PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_STOPS_CATALOG_URL`.

## 8. Publish

Preview the upload:

```powershell
.\scripts\upload-public-transport-stops-r2.ps1 -DryRun
```

Publish:

```powershell
.\scripts\upload-public-transport-stops-r2.ps1
```

The script:

1. verifies the complete local release, including the Brotli round trip;
2. reads the validated release identity and derives the immutable remote path;
3. uploads the Brotli catalog as `stops.json` with HTTP Brotli metadata;
4. uploads `release.json` last;
5. verifies the release through the configured public URL.

A real upload uses `rclone --immutable`; an existing release path must therefore
be treated as read-only rather than corrected in place.

## 9. Public verification

The upload script runs public verification automatically. It can also be run
explicitly:

```powershell
npm run verify:published-public-transport-stops -- `
  --base-url "https://data.example.org/public-transport-stops-sha256-0123456789abcdef/format-v3/ch" `
  --source "C:\Data\ViaHelveticaPublicTransport\public-transport-stops-sha256-0123456789abcdef\format-v3\ch" `
  --origin "https://viahelvetica.example.org"
```

For quick manual diagnostics, remember that the catalog is stored pre-compressed:

```powershell
curl --compressed "<catalog-url>"
curl -sSI "<catalog-url>"
curl -sS "<release-url>"
```

Verification checks:

- public release identity against the local manifest;
- CORS for the application origin;
- `application/json` metadata;
- one-year immutable cache metadata;
- `Content-Encoding: br` for `stops.json`;
- decoded byte length and SHA-256 against the local release;
- catalog provenance and record count after JSON parsing.

## 10. Application configuration

After a release passes public verification, configure the application with its
immutable object URL:

```text
VITE_PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_STOPS_CATALOG_URL=https://data.example.org/public-transport-stops-sha256-0123456789abcdef/format-v3/ch/stops.json
```

The application loads the catalog only when the public-transport layer is first
used. If the variable is unset, the application uses the GeoAdmin identify
provider. If the variable is set but the catalog cannot be loaded, there is no
automatic runtime fallback; deployment therefore validates the configured URL
before building.

Before changing production, perform a browser smoke test against the published R2
URL: point `.env.local` to it, run `npm run dev`, confirm stops around Lausanne and
Zurich, inspect at least one accented stop name, click a stop and confirm departures,
and check the browser console for CORS errors.

## 11. Updating the dataset

For a new official source publication:

1. run `npm run download:public-transport-stops-source -- <work-directory>`;
2. inspect the discovered official STAC asset URL and extracted
   `PointExploitation.csv`;
3. generate the new release and compare its final count with the previous release:

   ```powershell
   npm run prepare:public-transport-stops-release -- `
     "<work-directory>" `
     --release-root "<release-root>" `
     --previous-release "<previous-release-directory>"
   ```

   The generator fails when the count changes by more than 5%; investigate such a
   change instead of weakening the threshold blindly.
4. inspect the resolved columns, accepted row count, source SHA-256, and sizes;
5. run `npm test` and `npm run build` when application code changed;
6. publish under the newly derived immutable path;
7. verify the public release;
8. perform the browser smoke test described above against the new immutable URL;
9. update the GitHub repository variable `VITE_PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_STOPS_CATALOG_URL`;
10. manually run the Pages `workflow_dispatch` deployment because changing a
    repository variable does not trigger a deployment by itself;
11. validate the production layer, then retain the previous release for rollback.

Do not introduce GTFS or timetable joins into this pipeline merely to remove rare
stops without current departures. The static catalog represents official stop
metadata; dynamic departure availability remains a separate concern.


## 12. Rollback

Rollback never modifies or deletes R2 data. Restore
`VITE_PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_STOPS_CATALOG_URL` to the previous immutable catalog URL,
run the GitHub Pages workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch`, and verify the
public-transport layer in production. Old immutable releases remain available so
rollback is only an application redeployment.
